# Markdown Features

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. In this guide, we will explore various features of Markdown including images, videos, code snippets, and more.


## Introduction

Markdown is widely used for creating rich text using a plain text editor. It is often used in documentation, blog posts, and even notes.


# Example Layout with Image and Text

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">

  <!-- Image on the left -->
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <img src="https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png" alt="Image" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;">
  </div>

  <!-- Text on the right -->
  <div style="flex: 2;">
    Here is some introductory text that aligns next to the image. This text can continue with more details, creating the appearance of a block of text next to the image.

  </div>

## Videos

Markdown doesn't natively support video embedding, but you can include HTML tags for this purpose. Here's an example using an embedded YouTube video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT1v33oA1gI&t=924s" title="YouTube video" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted
