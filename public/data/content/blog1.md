# Markdown Features

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. In this guide, we will explore various features of Markdown including images, videos, code snippets, and more.


## Introduction

Markdown is widely used for creating rich text using a plain text editor. It is often used in documentation, blog posts, and even notes.



## Images

You can include images in your Markdown documents. Here's an example:

This image shows the logo of Markdown.

## Code Snippets

You can add code snippets in Markdown using triple backticks for a code block. Here's an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
## Video 

Markdown doesn't natively support video embedding, but you can include HTML tags for this purpose. Here's an example using an embedded YouTube video:

<div class="video-container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="YouTube video" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
